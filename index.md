### CPSC 120

Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3 was a favorite because I was curious how computers create smooth animations. I was able to write functions that can increase or decrease the speed of the animation.

Lab 10
    Lab 10, part 3 was a favorite because I finally understood how gradients work. I was able to work on functions that created a smooth gradient between the three channels, blue, green and red. 

Lab 12
    Lab 12, part 1 was another favorite because we learn to make a beautiful animation gradient as the image changes vertically and horizontally. I was able to write functions that keep the gradient moving by combining the three color channels together.
